#INSTRUCTIONS
This is a 2 part project.  

Part 1: Create a new file called main.py within the PyBank folder to be the main python script to run for each analysis.
Create 2 additional folders, one called 'resources' folder that contains the CSV file with the raw revenue data to read.  In the script, I will need to make sure that main.py has the correct path to the CSV file.  The second folder, called 'analysis' will be the location for the output text file from the analysis results.
Results will be both printed and saved to a text output file.
Push these changes to GitHub or GitLab.
Part 2: Create a new file called main.py within the PyPoll folder to be the main python script to run for each analysis.
Create 2 additional folders, one called 'resources' folder that contains the csv file with the raw voting data to read.  In this script, I will need to make sure that main.py has the correct path to the csv file.  The second folder, called 'analysis' will be the location for the output text file rom the analysis results.
Results will both be printed and saved to text output file.
Once completed, Push these changes to GitHub or GitLab

I had some issues with paths.  Took a lot of time to weed through what worked best.  Not sure if part of the problem was from testing from dropbox instead of repository.
